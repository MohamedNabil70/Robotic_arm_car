# Robotic_arm_car

New project

A prototype for a car with robot arm above it, that we can implement in future with bigger size and capability.

With bigger scale we can use it in inspection and handling hazardous work which is dangerous for human such as band aid in wars or Explosive detection.

The car and arm is fully wireless control using Nrf24101 Bluetooth Module with SPI protocol.
